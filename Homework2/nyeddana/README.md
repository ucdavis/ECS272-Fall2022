# Airline Passenger Satisfaction

The visualization dashboard provides an overview of how different types of customers scored different features/parameters of a particular Airline.

The advanced visualization used here is a Radar Plot, which provides an overview of different types of customers and their average ratings against each category.

The multi-line and grouped bar charts help visualize more dimensions of the data and how they relate to each other.

There are also some interactive components such as dropdowns and radio buttons to modify the inputs (datasets, parameters, categories), to understand how different factors affect a particular rating.
