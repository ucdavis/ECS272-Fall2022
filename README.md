# UPDATED Portion of README For Assignment 2
1. Change directory into the Vue-Skeleton template
2. Run `npm i` to install node modules as needed
3. Run `npm run start` to start the sever.

DIMENSIONS: For optimal scaling and dimensions, I developed and tested on a standard 24" 1080p monitor. You can also try to resize the scale to 1920 x 929 in case the current view is off. You can however feel free to use whatever you'd like, if when running `npm run start` and the view looks fine as is then no need to change it. Otherwise, try to adjust it to the dimensions I've given and hopefully it should look a little better.

# Welcome to ECS272 Information Visualization
This repository contains class materials for ECS 272 in Fall 2022.

## Time and Location
* Lecture Time: __12:10 - 1:30pm Tuesday and Thursday__
* Location: __Hart 1150__

## Instructors and Office Hours
* Instructor: [Kwan-Liu Ma](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~ma)
* Teaching Assistant: Keshav Dasu
* TA Office Hours: Wednesday 1-3PM (Zoom)

## Course Description
In this class, you will learn about information visualization  (InfoVis) techniques and their applications in a variety of fields. Through lectures and doing homework assignments and projects, you will learn and practice how to derive a visualization solution by integrating data analysis methods, visualization techniques, findings in human visual perception studies, concepts and principles in art, and ideas found in several other areas. While this is an introductory course, students are also expected to read research papers. You can take this class if you have received undergraduate training in computer science. However, if you have taken ECS163, ECS164, ECS171, ECS175, or ECS177 (or equivalent), you will likely be able to pursue advanced InfoVis topics for your final project. 

## Homeworks and Project
There are there homework assignments and one final project. Please find all the materials, including descriptions, tutorials, guidelines, and coding templates, from the folder assigned for each assignment and project in this GitHub repository.

* [Homework 1: Static Visualization](Homework1)
* [Homework 2: Visualization Dashboard](Homework2)
* [Homework 3: Interaction Design](Homework3)

Here's a [list of resources](Resources.md) that can be helpful for the assignments and project.
