# UPDATED (AGAIN) Portion of README For Assignment 3
Will be the same instructions and dimensions as for HW2, as you'll see right below:
1. Change directory into the `Vue-Skeleton` template under `Homework 2` folder.
2. Run `npm i` to install node modules as needed
3. Run `npm run start` to start the sever.

Please use the latest hash in the git commit log to find the code submission for Assignment 3! This should also be the latest changes within the pull request itself.

Cool NEW Features for HW3!
1. Focus View: Parallel Coordinates showing intensity. `Interaction technique includes brushing`, which then filters the sunburst chart.
2. Pressing on a decade in the sunburst chart displays an `interaction technique` and `an animation` showing the top 10 songs of that decade. After selecting one decade the radar chart will update showing the top 3 songs and their attributes. The color scheme of the radar legend will match that of the stroke of the top 3 songs on the sunburst chart.
4. Hovering over a song in sunburst will display full name and popularity score to the right.
3. Deselecting the brushing on the parallel coordinates chart will reset both the sunburst and the radar charts to their default views.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me! :)

# UPDATED Portion of README For Assignment 2
1. Change directory into the `Vue-Skeleton` template under `Homework 2` folder.
2. Run `npm i` to install node modules as needed
3. Run `npm run start` to start the sever.

Please use this link for the correct up to date code submission for Homework 2. It contains the git commit hash for the final commit for HW2:
https://github.com/ucdavis/ECS272-Fall2022/tree/aca108f5dd5728a7e6db68eeda6219ba1fa4ece2

Feel free to also check the git commit logs in the pull request if you have any questions or reach out to me.


DIMENSIONS: For optimal scaling and dimensions, I developed and tested on a standard 24" 1080p monitor. You can also try to resize the scale to 1920 x 929 in case the current view is off. You can however feel free to use whatever you'd like, if when running `npm run start` and the view looks fine as is then no need to change it. Otherwise, try to adjust it to the dimensions I've given and hopefully it should look a little better.

# Welcome to ECS272 Information Visualization
This repository contains class materials for ECS 272 in Fall 2022.

## Time and Location
* Lecture Time: __12:10 - 1:30pm Tuesday and Thursday__
* Location: __Hart 1150__

## Instructors and Office Hours
* Instructor: [Kwan-Liu Ma](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~ma)
* Teaching Assistant: Keshav Dasu
* TA Office Hours: Wednesday 1-3PM (Zoom)

## Course Description
In this class, you will learn about information visualization  (InfoVis) techniques and their applications in a variety of fields. Through lectures and doing homework assignments and projects, you will learn and practice how to derive a visualization solution by integrating data analysis methods, visualization techniques, findings in human visual perception studies, concepts and principles in art, and ideas found in several other areas. While this is an introductory course, students are also expected to read research papers. You can take this class if you have received undergraduate training in computer science. However, if you have taken ECS163, ECS164, ECS171, ECS175, or ECS177 (or equivalent), you will likely be able to pursue advanced InfoVis topics for your final project. 

## Homeworks and Project
There are there homework assignments and one final project. Please find all the materials, including descriptions, tutorials, guidelines, and coding templates, from the folder assigned for each assignment and project in this GitHub repository.

* [Homework 1: Static Visualization](Homework1)
* [Homework 2: Visualization Dashboard](Homework2)
* [Homework 3: Interaction Design](Homework3)

Here's a [list of resources](Resources.md) that can be helpful for the assignments and project.
