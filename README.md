# UPDATED (AGAIN) Portion of README For Assignment 3 (Scroll Down to See Assignment 2 Updates)
Will be the same instructions and dimensions as for HW2, as you'll see right below:
1. Change directory into the `Vue-Skeleton` template under `Homework 2` folder.
2. Run `npm i` to install node modules as needed
3. Run `npm run start` to start the sever.

Please use the latest hash in the git commit log to find the code submission for Assignment 3! This should also be the latest changes within the pull request itself.

Cool NEW Features for HW3!
1. Focus View: Parallel Coordinates showing intensity. `Interaction technique includes brushing`, which then filters the sunburst chart.
2. Pressing on a decade in the sunburst chart displays an `interaction technique` and `an animation` showing the top 10 songs of that decade. After selecting one decade the radar chart will update showing the top 3 songs and their attributes. The color scheme of the radar legend will match that of the stroke of the top 3 songs on the sunburst chart.
4. Hovering over a song in sunburst will display full name and popularity score to the right.
3. Deselecting the brushing on the parallel coordinates chart will reset both the sunburst and the radar charts to their default views.

DIMENSIONS: For optimal scaling and dimensions, I developed and tested on a standard 24" 1080p monitor. You can also try to resize the scale to 1920 x 929 in case the current view is off. You can however feel free to use whatever you'd like, if when running `npm run start` and the view looks fine as is then no need to change it. Otherwise, try to adjust it to the dimensions I've given and hopefully it should look a little better.
