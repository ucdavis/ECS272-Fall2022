# Airline Passenger Satisfaction

### Homework 2

The visualization dashboard provides an overview of how different types of customers scored different features/parameters of a particular Airline.

The advanced visualization used here is a Radar Plot, which provides an overview of different types of customers and their average ratings against each category.

The multi-line and grouped bar charts help visualize more dimensions of the data and how they relate to each other.

There are also some interactive components such as dropdowns and radio buttons to modify the inputs (datasets, parameters, categories), to understand how different factors affect a particular rating.

### Homework 3

The Radar plot uses d3 selection to remove any blob to ensure all data groups are clearly visible.
The line chart employs animation while transitioning between parameters. 
Finally, the bar chart (grouped), has d3 brush implemented to compare adjacent groups. The stacked view can be used to view specific values of each parameter.
